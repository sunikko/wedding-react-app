# 💍 React Wedding Invitation Project

I’ve just started a small side project — a **React-based digital wedding invitation** that I’m actually building to use for a friend’s wedding.

It’s something I’ve been curious about for a while, and I thought it would be a fun way to sharpen my React skills while experimenting with design and interactivity.

I’m learning by reading through an existing source and experimenting on my own — with **GPT as my coding partner**.  
Rather than just making it work, my goal is to understand the *“why”* behind each part of the code and explore different ways to make it smoother and more efficient.

## Goals

- Build a smooth, interactive wedding invitation page with **React**
- Optimise static resources (images, videos, fonts)
- Reduce unnecessary rendering and improve UX
- Experiment with TDD (Test-Driven Development) — see how testing changes the way components are structured

---

## Project Overview

The base source includes several interesting parts:

- Lightweight **local API setup** using `JSON-Server`
- Components for:
  - Intro video  
  - Image gallery  
  - RSVP modal  
  - Map and contact section
- Multiple optimisation and UX improvement opportunities 

I’ll start by setting up the environment and understanding how data flows between components and the mock API.  
Once I get a better feel for the structure, I’ll begin **refactoring** and applying my own ideas.

All of this is geared towards creating a **polished invitation** that will actually be used in a real wedding.

## How I’m Learning

I’m using **GPT as my coding partner**, asking questions and exploring different approaches together.  
Of course, I’m keeping the **official React documentation** open as well — just to make sure GPT doesn’t get *too* creative. 

---

## Next Steps

- Set up the **base layout**
- Work on the **intro video section**
- Add interactivity and animations
- Write small **tests for key components**

I’m really excited to see this project grow — both as a learning experience and as something that will be used in a real wedding.
